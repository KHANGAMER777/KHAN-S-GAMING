                creativity.

                The game allows players to explore and manipulate a 3D world made up of blocks, and it quickly became
                known
                for its distinctive pixelated graphics and open-ended gameplay. Minecraft has been continuously updated
                and
                expanded upon over the years, with new features and content being added to the game regularly.
